        <p className="lead">Artists find ways to express themselves with almost any resource available. It is a mark of creativity to make extraordinary images and objects from various, but often somewhat ordinary, materials. Using charcoal, paper, thread, paint, ink – and even found objects such as leaves – artists continue to search for ways to construct and deliver their message. In this unit, we look at artworks created from two- and three-dimensional media and arts made using different types of cameras.</p>
